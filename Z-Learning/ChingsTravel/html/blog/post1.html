                    Many of you might have already know this, Hallstatt is a UNESCO heritage site, making it one of the most popular tourist attraction in Austria. The total population in the village is only about 700, but the number of tourists is averagely 10,000 per day, imagine ten thousands of unknown people visiting your village everyday lol.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The hotels within the Hallstatt village are very expensive (home stay is about RM750 per night, hotel Rm1k++) , therefore we did some research and decided to stay in another village which is only 5km away from Hallstatt, and it’s called Obertraun. We traveled from Salzburg to Obertraun by train, the entire trip was about 2 hours and 40 minutes.
                </p>

                    </figcaption>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The journey to Obertraun required one transit though, when we got nearer to Hallstatt, the view from train was superbbbbb.
                </p>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Obertraun station is just one station after Hallstatt station, most of the passengers got down in Hallstatt station and went to the Hallstatt village by ferry.

                    The hotel we booked on Airbnb is called Seerose Hotel, it was just about 5 minutes walking distance from the station.

                    When writing this blog and checking back the bookings, I realized that we actually accidentally booked a double bedroom that doesn’t come with kitchen, but somehow what we got was an apartment with living room and kitchen, we paid for about RM260 for the room per night, but the apartment costs RM370 per night lol, not sure whether it was a mistake or the owner gave us a free upgrade, but it’s super lucky hahaha.

                    Spent some time at the balcony taking photos because the view and sunlight was just on point.

                    If you are planning to visit Hallstatt, no matter if you are gonna stay in Obertraun or Hallstatt, prepare your own food or cooking ingredients before reaching. There wasn’t any supermarket near to us, and we visited Hallstatt during weekend so the supermarkets we could find didn’t operate as well, sigh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily there was a restaurant nearby our Airbnb, Pizzeria Kegelbahn, a neighborhood concept of restaurant that serves homemade pizza and variety of spaghetti that you might not able to find in other restaurants in Austria, with super reasonable price some more.
                </p>

                <div class="img_type-half"> 
                    <img src="../../images/article/blog1/pic13.webp" height="700rem" width="100%">
                    <figcaption>Both with generous amount of meat and seafoodddd</figcaption>
                </div>

                <p>
                    There were direct buses to Hallstatt village, but it was not very frequent, so we sat and waited in the restaurant enjoying tea before heading to the bus stop. The bus stop was just 2 minutes walk from the restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A memorable trip would not be perfect without doing some stupid stuffs lol, we did not get down when everyone else did at the ONE and ONLY Hallstatt bus stop, because we thought the bus will continue its route to the popular platform that tourists often take photos at. The bus continue driving to highway, me and my husband then realized that we were further away from Hallstatt already and we quickly got down at the next stop, checked google map and noticed that the next bus back to Hallstatt would be 2 hours later!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, husband decided to ask the bus driver whether is there anyway we could get back to the Hallstatt village since the bus wasn’t leaving yet, then he said “this bus”, we then quickly went up the bus, paid for another time lol but phewwww.

                    We reached Hallstatt village at about 4pm, welcomed by a beautiful white swan.
